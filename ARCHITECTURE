0000-HLT | Halts computer. START->1 causes computer to begin. Address ignored.
0001-ADD | Address added to ACC->ACC. If ->ACC > 2^15 - 1 || ->ACC < -2^15, then stop computer. Contents of Address unchanged.
0010-XOR | XOR of contents of Address with ACC->ACC. Contents of Address unchanged.
0011-AND | AND of contents of Address with ACC->ACC. Contents of Address unchanged.
0100-IOR | OR of conntents of Address with ACC->ACC. Contents of Address unchanged.
0101-NOT | NOT of contents of ACC->ACC. Address ignored.
0110-LDA | Contents of Address->ACC. Contents of Address unchanged. 
0111-STA | Contents of ACC->Address. Contents of ACC unchanged.
1000-SRJ | Contents of PC | low 12 bits of ACC. Address->PC. Used to jump to subroutine.
1001-JMA | If sign of ACC=1, Address->PC. if sign of ACC=0, nothing.
1010-JMP | Address->PC.
1011-INP | Higher 8 bits of ACC->0, TBI
1100-OUT | 
1101-RAL | ACC << 1. Address ignored.
1110-CSA | SR->ACC. Address ignored.
1111-NOP | No op. Address ignored.
